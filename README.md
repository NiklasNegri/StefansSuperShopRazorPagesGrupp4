Assignment consisted of working together in a team of four, with one member being scrum master and our teacher being the product owner.
We had to write tests, implement a backend as well as fix bugs in the frontend and improving upon it.
Work was planned and executed in an Agile environment, with two sprint plannings, daily standups and two meetings with our product owner at the end of our sprints.
